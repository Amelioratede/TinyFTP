# TODO list
TODO list is used to plan tasks we will do.
* Tasks formats should always be **data first**
* Then the jobs temporarily should have be done
-------------------------------------------------
**Data: 2017/5/17**
## Functionality
* **queue** should be added in the program, when big file is downloading, queue is the key to realize mutitasking
* a **complete menu**, in which the function it may or not be implemented, but should be a beacon to tell us what we should to do for the next step
* Qt's **what's this** feature need to be added in the program
## UI design
* pick up some icons for program, this may delay until the functionality job has done
## Others
* I have no idea what the next step is, just go with it. : )
